# Arduino Traffic Light Control  

## Objective  
Simulate a simple traffic light system using an **Arduino Uno**, three LEDs (**Red, Yellow, Green**), and a **push button** for pedestrian crossing.  

## Components Needed  
- **Arduino Uno**  
- **LEDs:** Red, Yellow, Green  
- **Resistors:** 3 × 220Ω (for LEDs), 1 × 10kΩ (for push button)  
- **Push Button** (for pedestrian crossing)  
- **Breadboard & Jumper Wires**  

## Working  
- The LEDs follow a standard traffic light sequence: **Green → Yellow → Red → Green**.  
- When the **push button** is pressed, the system **immediately switches to Red** for pedestrian crossing.  
- After a short delay, it returns to the normal traffic light cycle.
